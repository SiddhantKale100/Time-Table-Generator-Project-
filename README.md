# Time-Table-Generator-Project-


It a typical scheduling problem that appears to be a tedious job in every academic institute once or twice a year. In earlier days, time table scheduling was done manually with a single person or some group involved in task of scheduling it manually, which takes a lot of effort and time. Planning timetables is one of the most complex and error-prone applications.

There are basically two types of constraints, soft constraints and hard 
constraints,which we have to take care o

Soft-constraints (flexible):

• More or less equal load is given to all faculties

• Required time (hours per week) is given to every Batch

Hard-constraints (rigid):

• There should not be any single instance of a faculty taking two classes simultaneously

• A class group must not have more than one lectures at the same time
